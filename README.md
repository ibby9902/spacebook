## Introduction

This was an app developed as part of my BSc Computer Science degree, in my final year module: "Mobile Applications Development".
The aim was to connect with a provided backend & produce an app where users could post to other peoples' profiles. The user can do the following:
- Sign up and login to their account
- View a users' profile including their name, profile image, friend count, friends and posts
- Add posts to their own profile or a friends
- Like a friends posts, search other users & add friends
- Save posts as drafts & schedule a post for any given day and time

Things I learned through building this project:
- The intricacies of Javascript
- User Interface / User Experience as I had to show error messages received from the backend
- Building a React Native app from scratch, using functional components & hooks
- Using third party libraries such as AsyncStorage to store data locally in the browser and ESLint to ensure code quality
- Project management
